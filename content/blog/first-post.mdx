## The Day Chaos Met Courage

On a sweltering afternoon in June, the relentless buzz of vehicles zipped across the National Highway 117 in West Bengal. Among the speeding trucks and honking cars, a trembling puppy — barely a few months old — stood frozen in the middle of the road. Alone. Frightened. Inches away from a tragedy.

What followed was a series of events that turned ordinary citizens into heroes, and a vulnerable life into a symbol of hope.

## A Routine Drive Turned into a Life-Saving Mission

Arjun, a 29-year-old delivery driver, was on his usual route when he noticed something unusual on the highway divider. A small, tan-colored pup, visibly shaking, was trapped between the concrete barriers, unable to move forward or back.

"I couldn't believe my eyes," Arjun later told our volunteers. "Cars were missing him by inches. One wrong move and..."

Without a second thought, Arjun slowed down, turned on his hazard lights, and ran toward the divider. A few other drivers followed suit, halting traffic briefly and shielding the little pup with their bodies.

## The Rescue: Seconds Between Life and Death

While vehicles honked and impatience grew around them, these strangers worked in synchrony. The pup was too scared to let anyone approach, barking and trying to bite anyone who came close.

But one woman — Riya, a veterinary nurse traveling to her clinic — took the lead. Using her scarf and some treats she had for stray dogs, she managed to coax the pup into her arms.

It took 7 minutes. But to those on the highway, it felt like forever.
