## A Law That Speaks for the Voiceless

Enacted in 1960, the **Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act** remains one of India's foundational animal welfare laws. It lays down what qualifies as cruelty — from beating or torturing animals to overloading working animals or denying food and water.

### What Constitutes Cruelty?

- Beating or kicking an animal  
- Keeping animals in cages with inadequate space  
- Overworking sick or old animals  
- Poisoning street animals  
- Abandoning pets or animals

> “Every act of cruelty, no matter how small, chips away at our humanity.”

### Penalties

- Fines starting from ₹10 to ₹100 (though considered outdated today)
- Imprisonment up to **3 months** for repeat offenses
- Prosecution under IPC sections for severe cases

## How You Can Help

- **Report cruelty** to the local police or animal welfare officer  
- **Document** evidence — videos/photos are powerful  
- Support NGOs filing PILs to push for stronger enforcement and updates to this old act

This law may be over 60 years old, but it’s the **first legal voice** for India’s animals — and it’s still fighting.
