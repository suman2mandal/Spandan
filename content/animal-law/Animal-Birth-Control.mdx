## Stray Dogs Are Protected â€” Know the ABC Rules

Indiaâ€™s **Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001** are a legal framework that balances public safety and animal rights.

They mandate **humane birth control and vaccination**, and most importantly, **prohibit relocation or killing of stray dogs**.

### Key Provisions

- Stray dogs must be **captured**, **sterilized**, **vaccinated**, and **released back** to the same location  
- Killing or relocating dogs is **illegal** unless the animal is rabid and certified by a vet  
- Local authorities **must create ABC programs** in collaboration with NGOs

```md
ðŸ“Œ It's illegal to beat, remove, or poison street dogs.
