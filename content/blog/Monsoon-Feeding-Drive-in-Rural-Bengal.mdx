## When It Rains, We Don’t Retreat — We Rise

In July, as Bengal’s monsoon clouds gathered over fields and villages, roads turned to mud and skies roared with thunder. For most, it’s a time to stay in. But for Spandan’s volunteers, the rains signal something else entirely — **urgency**.

Because when the roads are flooded, and food scarce, stray animals suffer the most.

> This is the story of our **Monsoon Feeding Drive 2025** in the remotest pockets of rural Bengal — a story of resilience, compassion, and wet paws.

## Into the Heart of the Villages

We began in the **rural districts of South 24 Parganas**, covering areas like Baruipur, Bhangar, and Basanti. Our small team of five, along with sacks of rice, boiled chicken, biscuits, and clean drinking water, set out on bicycles, foot, and borrowed two-wheelers.
